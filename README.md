# GBF3_Paper
This is the repository of the study "Who pays for a protected Earth? Unequal Economic Exposure in the race to GBF Target 3" authored by Adam Poupard and Gabriel Santos Carneiro

**Contents:**

- "raw_direct_data" folder contains all the csv files, both sectors-wise 
aggregated and disaggregated at country-level, for each 4 scenarios. 
These direct exposure vectors are used in the study as an input to the Input-Output analysis after being set in coherence and aggregated with 
GLORIA agricultural sectors.

- "Results for Figures and Total Results_Nature" contains the results underpinning the study submitted to Nature Ecology and Evolution. The first tabs indicate the values used to create each figure. Other tabs are named after the scenarios and displays results at country and sectoral level of disaggregation. There you can find direct exposure estimates, not capped indirect and total exposure estimates, capped indirect and total estimates, sectoral output from GLORIA, and the share of total capped estimates in relation to total sectoral output.
